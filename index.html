    <h1>Rashid M. Baset</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>A little bit about myself, I'm 28 years old and live in Seattle, WA. I'm currently a student at a computer programmings school,<a href="http://www.codefellows.com">Code Fellows</a>, learning web development. Before joining Code Fellows, I was a program administrator briefly for an e-education platform and before that, a help desk analyst for my undergraduate university, Wayne State University in Detroit, MI.</p>

      <p>I was born in Chicago, IL and raised in West Bloomfield, MI by my lovely parents. I have an older brother who is a public prosector in Washington D.C and who has influenced me greatly. I like reading articles online and starbucks coffee.
